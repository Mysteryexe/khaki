          <p>I am an Iranian Architect and member of faculty. Due to my academic and professional background, I have tried to develop the relationship between teaching, research, and making in my works as soon as possible. In this view, architecture is a field, not just a discipline, and therefore, I need to make journeys in the overlapping fields and disciplines with architecture. Philosophy, poetry, and psychology are from those that I have developed some experiences in overlaps of them with architecture. Recently, my research has guided me to the intersection between architecture and health. The root of this orientation refers to my Ph.D. thesis that noticed esoteric architectural order. The result argued architectural order system at top of the hierarchy of it, meets “inside of inside” that brings “privacy”, “restoration”, “dignity” and “within happiness” to users and such quality could evolve human beings.</p>
